The Golem network is a p2p network of computers. It is being created by a community of people who believe that decentralization is an idea that deserves their support and who want to participate and take advantage of the Golem project.

You can also support our open-source project and earn some tokens by joining the network. All you need to do is to install our Yagna daemon. It is a simple and quick process. See our tutorial on how to quickly install the Yagna daemon and join the Golem Network.

Once you installed the daemon don't forget to join the discord channel of our community to meet great people who share the same values as you.

In the network you can have two roles: you can request HW resource to run your apps - then you are a requestor, or you can share your free HW in exchange for GLM tokens - then you become a provider.

For all this to happen each node must run a piece of software that implements the protocol that was designed by our open-source project. Yagna is our Rust implementation and is freely distributed to the community. If you have a computer running Linux you can easily join the network and become a provider.

Programs of other network users are run in separate containers and are isolated from your programs.
You define how many resources you want to dedicate and at any time your processes have priority. You can switch off your computer whenever you want - you participate as much and when you want.

You set the price for your resources. Price is defined in GLM - a golemfactory token defined on the Ethereum network. You can use the token to pay for your tasks in the network or monetize it on the exchange.

Once you install and configure your daemon your resources are offered in the network. Since this moment everything is done automatically: requestors can select your offer and once the agreement is signed, send the task to your computer to execute it. While the tasks are running your node will send `debitNotes` to obtain ongoing requestor acceptance and once the task is done an Golem `invoice` is sent. The transaction is performed on blockchain and as a result, you become an owner of some GLM.
